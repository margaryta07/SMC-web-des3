            <div class="col-12 col-md-6 col-lg-8" style="background-color:#ff3333; padding: 10px; margin: 5px 0px;">Red is the color at the long wavelength end of the visible spectrum of light, next to orange and opposite violet. It has a dominant wavelength of approximately 625â€“740 nanometres. It is a primary color in the RGB color model and a secondary color (made from magenta and yellow) in the CMYK color model, and is the complementary color of cyan. Reds range from the brilliant yellow-tinged scarlet and vermillion to bluish-red crimson, and vary in shade from the pale red pink to the dark red burgundy.</div>
            <div class="col-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4" style="background-color: #ff6666; padding: 10px; margin: 5px 0px;">Red pigment made from ochre was one of the first colors used in prehistoric art. The Ancient Egyptians and Mayans colored their faces red in ceremonies; Roman generals had their bodies colored red to celebrate victories. </div>
            <div class="col-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4" style="background-color:#ff8080; padding: 10px; margin: 5px 0px;">Since red is the color of blood, it has historically been associated with sacrifice, danger, and courage. Modern surveys in Europe and the United States show red is also the color most commonly associated with heat, activity, passion, sexuality, anger, love, and joy. In China, India and many other Asian countries it is the color symbolizing happiness and good fortune.</div>           
            <div class="col-6 col-md-6 col-lg-4" style="background-color:#ff1a1a; padding: 10px; margin: 5px 0px;">Varieties of the color red may differ in hue, chroma (also called saturation, intensity, or colorfulness), or lightness (or value, tone, or brightness), or in two or three of these qualities. Variations in value are also called tints and shades, a tint being a red or other hue mixed with white, a shade being mixed with black. Four examples are shown below.</div> 
            <div class="col-6 col-md-3 col-lg-4" style="background-color: #b30000; padding: 10px; margin: 5px 0px;">The human eye sees red when it looks at light with a wavelength between approximately 625 and 740 nanometers. It is a primary color in the RGB color model and the light just past this range is called infrared, or below red, and cannot be seen by human eyes, although it can be sensed as heat.</div>
            <div class="col-6" style="background-color:#e60000; padding: 10px; margin: 5px 0px;">On the color wheel long used by painters, and in traditional color theory, red is one of the three primary colors, along with blue and yellow. Painters in the Renaissance mixed red and blue to make violet: Cennino Cennini, in his 15th-century manual on painting, wrote, "If you want to make a lovely violet colour, take fine lac [red lake], ultramarine blue (the same amount of the one as of the other) with a binder"; he noted that it could also be made by mixing blue indigo and red hematite.</div>           
            <div class="col-6 col-md-3 col-lg-6" style="background-color:#ff4d4d; padding: 10px; margin: 5px 0px;">In modern color theory, also known as the RGB color model, red, green and blue are additive primary colors. Red, green and blue light combined makes white light, and these three colors, combined in different mixtures, can produce nearly any other color. This is the principle that is used to make all of the colors on your computer screen and your television. For example, magenta on a computer screen is made by a similar formula to that used by Cennino Cennini in the Renaissance to make violet, but using additive colors and light instead of pigment.</div>
